# Introduction

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Task overview

Hi, can you provide me with an in depth analysis of our marketing efforts, based on the data provided in the attachment.

We'd like to focus our activities on markets which we can easily scale while keeping long term profitability.

Overview about our imaginary client:

Client is a global passenger transfer company which focuses on short distance transport. Their customers are mostly people travelling for holidays with family, but around 15% of business also falls in the business travel category.

Due to recent market changes they are looking into optimising their marketing efforts in order to overtake higher market share in the future; currently their main markets are US, UK, Argentina, and South Korea where they are market leaders with 30%+ market share

Their activities are in some markets mostly offline, while in others are just online.

The main points are:

-   scale markets easily

-   while keeping long term profitability

-   in order to gain higher market share

::: callout-warning
While one of the main points is around keeping *profitability* no data on marketing spend was provided which is essential in order to determine this.

Nevertheless, the data provided contained interesting insights and besides - it would be relatively easy to add this aspect to the existing analysis.
