In the above table for instance, scrolling to the last page shows pairs like e.g. (Spain, Twitter) , (Spain, sms) which have 1 user and 0 revenue.\nI would like to check the share of such low volume country/medium pairs. Again taking just some kind of cut-off points - I’m going to start with:\nrevenue &lt; 100  or  users &lt; 10  or  transaction &lt; 10\nas a simple rule to filter these out.\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country &lt;- medium_country |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    is_low_volume_medium = {\n      (revenue &lt; 50) & (users &lt; 5) & (transactions  &lt; 5)\n    }\n  ) \n\nmedium_country |&gt; \n  count(is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  mutate(perc = round(n / sum(n), 3)) |&gt; \n  datatable(options = list(dom = 't'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk seems like quite a big percentage of the country/medium pairs are actually low volume i.e. have less than 10 users, 10 transactions and 100 revenue. This seems quite a low benchmark so removing them seems the correct way to go because their contribution and impact is very limited.\nIn order to see the effect of this - I would like to check the number of mediums per country before and after the removal.\n\nBefore removalAfter removal\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = n_mediums, n = 20) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"mediumpurple4\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country - before removal of low volume mediums\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country |&gt;\n  filter( !is_low_volume_medium ) |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = n_mediums, n = 20) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"mediumpurple4\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country - after removal of low volume mediums\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like it halved the # of mediums per country.\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country |&gt;\n  mutate(is_low_volume_medium = factor(is_low_volume_medium, levels = c(T, F), ordered = T)) |&gt; \n  group_by(country, is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_mediums_total = sum(n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    country = fct_reorder(country, n_mediums_total, sum),\n    country = fct_lump(country, w = n_mediums_total, n = 20, ties.method = \"random\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( country != \"Other\" ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country, fill = is_low_volume_medium)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  #scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Is Low Volume Medium ?\",\n    values = c(`FALSE` = \"green4\", `TRUE` = \"red3\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country, coloured by Too Low / Ok volume ?\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlow_vol_mediums &lt;- \n  medium_country |&gt;\n  group_by(country, is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_mediums_total = sum(n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nlow_vol_mediums |&gt; \n  \n  mutate(\n    country = fct_lump(country, w = n_mediums_total, n = 20, ties.method = \"random\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( country != \"Other\" ) |&gt; \n  \n  mutate(\n    country = fct_reorder(country, ave(is_low_volume_medium, country), max),\n    fct_inorder()\n  ) |&gt; \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country, fill = is_low_volume_medium)) +\n  geom_col(position = position_fill(reverse = T)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Is Low Volume Medium ?\",\n    values = c(`FALSE` = \"green4\", `TRUE` = \"red3\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country, coloured by Too Low / Ok volume ?\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\"\n  )\n\n\n\nRemove low volume mediums\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country &lt;- medium_country |&gt;\n  filter(!is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  select(-is_low_volume_medium)"

    "text": "Conclusion for this part\nWhen looking at the revenue shares distributions, indeed referral has by far a distribution mostly centered around the right end of the axis. It’s interesting to see that it seems like it does not overlap at all with any of the (none), cpc, organic distributions i.e. there is no case for our client where one of these channels in a country - contribute as much as referral contributes in the “worst for referral” country. So quite consistent and convincing picture of the marketing medium mix in terms of what works for the client.\nFurthermore - seeing that organic, (none) which I consider free mediums - perform as well as cpc - makes me think that\ncpc performs better than organic in bringing (new) users - yet their revenue shares do not look vastly different. I would think that this is still ok - because bringing in new users especially means filling up the funnel for future referral’s.\nQuite obvious is how the distributions for referral, (none), cpc are close in terms of (new) users - but then a striking difference appears when switching the view to revenue. This means that:\n\nreferral brings 50% of the users but 70% of the revenue\n(none) brings 25% of the users but 7% of the revenue\n\nHence, the client does not manage to monetise mediums equally i.e. people coming from (none) usually bring less money than people coming from referral . However - keeping in mind that this is a view from the country_medium.csv file which means that this is the converting session coming from the last non-direct medium. In other words - referral does monetise the incoming users better, however this is not the whole picture as the other mediums might be contributing in other parts of the customer journey on the way to conversion. So it will be interesting to compare this view to the view that will come out of the conversion_paths.csv file i.e. the more general holistic view on the customer journey."

How much of the revenue do they contribute to ?\n\n\nCode\nby_country |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    too_low_volume = {\n      (revenue &lt;= 20000) | (users &lt;= 1000) | (transactions &lt;= 100)\n    }\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(too_low_volume) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    n_countries = n(),\n    revenue = sum(revenue)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    perc_revenue   = round(revenue / sum(revenue), 3),\n    perc_countries = round(n_countries / sum(n_countries), 3)\n  ) |&gt; \n  datatable(options = list(dom = 't'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would be removing 104 countries ~43% of the total number but half a percent in terms of revenue.

Compare this with 68.8% coming from referral\n\nthis is in contrast to the country/medium view where referral was always dominating the shares\n\nfrom an organic state - it’s more likely that the path continues to a cpc or (none) than to a (conversion)\n\norganic is an important middle-step in the customer journey that feeds the other mediums\n\nalso conversely, crossing a cpc paid search touchpoints is most likely coming from an organic search\nafter referral one wold most likely either convert or continue to a (none) touch\n\n\n\n\nGraph\nI found it a bit difficult to find an appropriate graph size and layout in order to be able to easily draw conclusions or see patterns and cliques in the data. It’s a pity that it just looks nice but it’s not super useful for most practical problems.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(\"igraph\")\n\ntop_mediums &lt;- c(\n  \"(start)\",\n  \"(conversion)\",\n  \"(none)\",\n  \"(not set)\",\n  \"cpc\",\n  \"email\",\n  \"organic\",\n  \"referral\"\n)\n\ntransition_matrix &lt;- transition_matrix |&gt; \n  filter(\n    channel_from %in% top_mediums,\n    channel_to %in% top_mediums\n  )\n\nnetwork &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(d = transition_matrix, directed = T)\n\nV(network)$color &lt;- case_match(\n  V(network)$name,\n   \"(start)\"       ~ \"darkslategray3\",\n    \"(conversion)\" ~ \"gold3\",\n    \"(none)\"    ~ \"darkolivegreen3\",\n    \"email\"     ~ \"darkolivegreen3\",\n    \"navbar\"    ~ \"darkolivegreen3\",\n    \"organic\"   ~ \"darkolivegreen3\",\n    \"referral\"  ~ \"darkolivegreen3\",\n    \"(not set)\" ~ \"firebrick2\",\n    \"cpc\"       ~ \"firebrick2\",\n    \"s-cpm\"     ~ \"firebrick2\"\n)\n\nplot(\n  network,\n  layout = layout_with_fr,\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.2,\n  edge.curved = F,\n  edge.label = percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(E(network)$transition_probability)\n)"

In this view it is almost on par actually with referral\ncpc seems to be very close in terms of attribution from both views\nthe order is the same but the % attributed value differs (at least for the top 2 mediums)"

Their customers are mostly people travelling for holidays with family, but around 15% of business also falls in the business travel category.\nDue to recent market changes they are looking into optimising their marketing efforts in order to overtake higher market share in the future; currently their main markets are US, UK, Argentina, and South Korea where they are market leaders with 30%+ market share\nTheir activities are in some markets mostly offline, while in others are just online.\n\n\nThe main goals are:\n\nscale markets easily\nwhile keeping long term profitability\nin order to gain higher market share\n\n\n\nWhile one of the main points is around keeping profitability no data on marketing spend was provided which is essential in order to determine this (for the paid channels like cpc).\nNevertheless, the data provided contained many interesting insights already - and besides that, I think it should not be too hard to also add this aspect to the existing analysis."
