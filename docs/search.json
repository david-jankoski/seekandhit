In the above table for instance, scrolling to the last page shows pairs like e.g. (Spain, Twitter) , (Spain, sms) which have 1 user and 0 revenue.\nI would like to check the share of such low volume country/medium pairs. Again taking just some kind of cut-off points - I’m going to start with:\nrevenue &lt; 100  or  users &lt; 10  or  transaction &lt; 10\nas a simple rule to filter these out.\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country &lt;- medium_country |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    is_low_volume_medium = {\n      (revenue &lt; 50) & (users &lt; 5) & (transactions  &lt; 5)\n    }\n  ) \n\nmedium_country |&gt; \n  count(is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  mutate(perc = round(n / sum(n), 3)) |&gt; \n  datatable(options = list(dom = 't'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk seems like quite a big percentage of the country/medium pairs are actually low volume i.e. have less than 10 users, 10 transactions and 100 revenue. This seems quite a low benchmark so removing them seems the correct way to go because their contribution and impact is very limited.\nIn order to see the effect of this - I would like to check the number of mediums per country before and after the removal.\n\nBefore removalAfter removal\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = n_mediums, n = 20) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"mediumpurple4\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country - before removal of low volume mediums\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country |&gt;\n  filter( !is_low_volume_medium ) |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = n_mediums, n = 20) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"mediumpurple4\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country - after removal of low volume mediums\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like it halved the # of mediums per country.\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country |&gt;\n  mutate(is_low_volume_medium = factor(is_low_volume_medium, levels = c(T, F), ordered = T)) |&gt; \n  group_by(country, is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_mediums_total = sum(n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    country = fct_reorder(country, n_mediums_total, sum),\n    country = fct_lump(country, w = n_mediums_total, n = 20, ties.method = \"random\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( country != \"Other\" ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country, fill = is_low_volume_medium)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  #scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Is Low Volume Medium ?\",\n    values = c(`FALSE` = \"green4\", `TRUE` = \"red3\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country, coloured by Too Low / Ok volume ?\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlow_vol_mediums &lt;- \n  medium_country |&gt;\n  group_by(country, is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_mediums = n_distinct(medium)) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_mediums_total = sum(n_mediums)) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nlow_vol_mediums |&gt; \n  \n  mutate(\n    country = fct_lump(country, w = n_mediums_total, n = 20, ties.method = \"random\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter( country != \"Other\" ) |&gt; \n  \n  mutate(\n    country = fct_reorder(country, ave(is_low_volume_medium, country), max),\n    fct_inorder()\n  ) |&gt; \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = n_mediums, y = country, fill = is_low_volume_medium)) +\n  geom_col(position = position_fill(reverse = T)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Is Low Volume Medium ?\",\n    values = c(`FALSE` = \"green4\", `TRUE` = \"red3\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"# of Mediums per Country, coloured by Too Low / Ok volume ?\",\n    x = \"# Mediums\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\"\n  )\n\n\n\nRemove low volume mediums\n\n\nCode\nmedium_country &lt;- medium_country |&gt;\n  filter(!is_low_volume_medium) |&gt; \n  select(-is_low_volume_medium)"

The “free” group of mediums in the medium-mix of the client are responsiblie for a big portion of the traffic and business - which is a good thing - in the sense that no (or little) marketing money is spent in order to generate this.\nProbably not entirely true as e.g. brand marketing would likely highly influcence the organic traffic, as well as email is not completely free (there are at least some operational as well probably very high licensing costs to partner with an email sending company/provider that can enable for high scale email sendout campaigns). Nevertheless - I believe the conclusion remains that basically a big share of the website traffic pie is brought by mostly free mediums."

    "text": "Conclusion for this part\nOk so far i think it is quite convincing picture that the main driver of revenue across all countries is referral. 2nd place is paid search / cpc with 8%.\n3rd and 4th place is organic / unknown / not set / none -&gt; for the sake of the\nwithout any harm we could assume these are actually all organic. that would make organic on par with paid search / cpc. this means free trafic brings as much revenue as paid traffic. ?!\nsince the client is a transport company (i imagine airline or train/bus company here) - i don’t expect email to be actually very efficient channel …i would not expect people to see/open some email and decide to actually travel somewhere ? it seems to me more like you would typically use a search engine to explore prices / opportunities –&gt; review your options –&gt; make a decision at some point - and very likely then go straight to the transport provider website (so organic revenue should be higher - if anything ?) but that’s maybe just personal experience.\nGoing out on a limb / perhaps bit too much reading the bottom of the coffee cup :-) I think that depending so much on referral might be “dangerous” for the client because referral can only get you so far i.e. existing customers referring the business to their friends and family. this does not sound like it would be “setup for scaling” i.e. in order to really scale up the business then it would be better to expand the organic / paid search / email marketing channels to be bigger engines of growth (but then again - we only have 1 year of data so this might indeed be the case - that these are indeed growing in the past years ?)"

    "text": "Countries that swap ranks drastically ?\nHowever I noticed something interesting here:\n\nLithuania which was one of the top drivers for (new) users - in terms of revenue dropped significantly\nI also have the sense that Australia - which was not even on the top 20 charts in terms of (new) users - jumped straight to the middle when we switched to revenue-view\n\nI would like to check this in a bit more detail by ranking the countries with respect to these metrics and checking the difference in these ranks.\n\n\nCode\ncountry_ranks &lt;- by_country |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    across(\n      c(users, transactions, revenue),\n      ~ dense_rank(desc(.x)),\n      .names = \"{col}_rank\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(country, ends_with(\"rank\")) |&gt; \n  arrange(transactions_rank)\n\ndatatable(country_ranks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would like to see which countries have either:\n\ndifference-in-ranks (users minus revenue rank) bigger than 20 or\nthe ratio of ranks is more than double (users to revenue rank)\n\n\n\nCode\ncountry_ranks |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ranks_diff = abs(users_rank - revenue_rank),\n    users_to_revenue_rank_ratio = users_rank / revenue_rank\n    ) |&gt; \n  filter(\n    (ranks_diff &gt; 20) | (users_to_revenue_rank_ratio &gt;= 2)\n    ) |&gt; \n  datatable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed it seems there are some interesting cases here:\n\nLithuania which is the 2nd biggest driver of users - is the 53rd place when it comes to revenue ?! This means that there are tons of users coming from Lithuania to the client’s website but somehow they do not monetise them. This seems odd\nIn addition to Australia - also Ireland and Japan seem to be 2x higher ranked in terms of revenue compared to rank in terms of users. This means that even though they do not bring the highest volumes of users to the website - they still manage to monetise them quite well - something to be investigated perhaps later (TODO: check their channel mix and see if it is any different than the others ?) (TODO: insert link to this in appendix)\n\nOnce more i want to make sure Lithuania is unusual and compare against e.g. Germany\nComparing the ratio of users vs. ratio of revenue for Lithuania vs. Germany\n\n\nCode\ncompare_users &lt;- by_country |&gt; \n  filter(country %in% c(\"Lithuania\", \"Germany\")) |&gt; \n  select(country, users) |&gt; \n  deframe()\n\ncompare_revenue &lt;- by_country |&gt; \n  filter(country %in% c(\"Lithuania\", \"Germany\")) |&gt; \n  select(country, revenue) |&gt; \n  deframe()\n\nc(\n  users = { comma_format()(compare_users) },\n  \n  users_ratio = {\n    (compare_users[\"Lithuania\"] / compare_users[\"Germany\"]) |&gt; \n      percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)()\n    \n  },\n  \n  revenue = { comma_format()(compare_revenue) },\n  \n  revenue_ratio = {\n    (compare_revenue[\"Lithuania\"] / compare_revenue[\"Germany\"]) |&gt;\n      percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)()\n  }\n)\n\n\n          users.Germany         users.Lithuania   users_ratio.Lithuania \n            \"1,889,501\"             \"2,773,044\"                \"146.8%\" \n        revenue.Germany       revenue.Lithuania revenue_ratio.Lithuania \n           \"12,906,843\"               \"786,699\"                  \"6.1%\" \n\n\nOk this is confirmation enough i guess:\n\nkeeping in mind that Lithuania is ~3 Mil people, Germany ~85 Mil people\nLithuania brings ~140% more users than Germany\nbut “only” 6% of the revenue of Germany\n\nThis could be either a “glitch” in the data - then something worth investigating further. Or it could be that the client is super popular in Lithuania but also has very cheap pricing - which could also explain these numbers."

    "text": "Hello and welcome to this project in which I tried to explain and present my analysis and thoughts around the interview task that I got from Ivan.\nI hope you find it interesting and I am looking forward to presenting it and discussing it with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask overview\n\n\n\nHi, can you provide me with an in depth analysis of our marketing efforts, based on the data provided in the attachment.\nWe’d like to focus our activities on markets which we can easily scale while keeping long term profitability.\nOverview about our imaginary client:\nClient is a global passenger transfer company which focuses on short distance transport. Their customers are mostly people travelling for holidays with family, but around 15% of business also falls in the business travel category.\nDue to recent market changes they are looking into optimising their marketing efforts in order to overtake higher market share in the future; currently their main markets are US, UK, Argentina, and South Korea where they are market leaders with 30%+ market share\nTheir activities are in some markets mostly offline, while in others are just online.\n\n\nThe main goals are:\n\nscale markets easily\nwhile keeping long term profitability\nin order to gain higher market share\n\n\n\nWhile one of the main points is around keeping profitability no data on marketing spend was provided which is essential in order to determine this (for the paid channels like cpc).\nNevertheless, the data provided contained many interesting insights already - and besides that, I think it should not be too hard to also add this aspect to the existing analysis."
