This is a condensed format of the main takeaways and does not bother with code or charts and is suitable for a quick and short overview.\nThe individual sections that look at the different views of the data can be found in Country, Country / Medium and Conversion paths. I tried to express here my thoughts and investigations into text and code to reflect my approach to this task.\nSome thoughts and ideas that did not fit anywhere above but were - in my opinion - worth keeping, can be found in the Appendix section."
